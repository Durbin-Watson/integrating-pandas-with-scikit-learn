    "The major objective of this tutorial is to teach the latest and most robust workflows for those that use pandas for data exploration and scikit-learn for machine learning. The primary focus will be on the new features added to version 0.20 of scikit-learn in September, 2018. [See the changelog here][1] for a list of all the new features.\n",

    "## 1. The Scikit-Learn Estimator\n",
    "The scikit-learn library has one primary type of object to do machine learning - the **estimator**.\n",

    "* Learn from data\n",

    "The following are common types of estimators. [Visit the glossary][1] to see more types.\n",
    "* Regressors - Supervised learning with continuous target\n",
    "* Classifiers - Supervised learning with categorical target\n",
    "* Clusterers - Unsupervised learning\n",
    "* Transformers - Transform the input/output data\n",
    "* Meta-estimators - Learn from other estimators\n",
    "\n",
    "### Helper Functions\n",
    "Nearly every object in scikit-learn is either an estimator or **helper function**. The helper functions perform a single task and written in snake_case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding estimators in the scikit-learn API\n",
    "The scikit-learn package is divided neatly into about 35 modules. Most modules contain several estimators. It can be valuable to take a look at the entire scikit-learn API to help learn which module an estimator is located in. Note that the estimators (CamelCase) are listed first in the modules followed by the helper functions. We display the API in the notebook below.\n",
